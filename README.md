## Features

These are some features the app has. Will change in each update, probably.

### Current features:

* None

### Planned features that will be added:

* Creation of spherical objects in a 3D space. Each object will have a radius, a mass, a 3D position, and an initial velocity
* Initial velocity will be represented by a vector drawn as an arrow
* The length of the arrow will depend on the vector's module and it will have a color
* Scale of the simulation can be changed
* Ability to select an object and modify it's parameters using an UI

### Planned features that might be added:

* Ability to change simulation's speed
* Ability to draw a line/curve predicting the trajectory of an object

### Features that will be added in the next update, or in the near future:

* 2D drawing of stellar objects
* 2D simulation
* Simple UI
